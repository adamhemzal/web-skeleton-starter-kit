## What you need before to run the web starter kit

- optional: you can also install **yarn** for better and easier package management

## How to install and run web starter kit
1) Download this kit
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/adamhemzal/web-skeleton-starter-kit.git
    ```

2) Initiate project. It'll create a `package.json` file. **I highly suggest using [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)** instead of npm

    yarn

    ```
    yarn init

    yarn init -y // I recommend using this line, because it'll skip the annoying questions.
    ```  
    
    npm

    ```
    npm init

    npm init -y // I recommend using this line, because it'll skip the annoying questions.
    ```


3) Install all packages. Simply copy and paste the code bellow. The same code can be found in a comment in `gulpfile.js`

    yarn

    ```
    yarn add --dev gulp del postcss browser-sync gulp-babel @babel/core @babel/preset-env gulp-sass gulp-sourcemaps node-sass gulp-rename gulp-size gulp-imagemin gulp-uglify gulp-newer gulp-cleanhtml gulp-wait2 gulp-postcss postcss-preset-env cssnano autoprefixer panini

## Workflow
TODO

### Using Fontello
- visit [Fontello](http://fontello.com/) site
- select icons which you want and need
- download icons using **Download** button on the website
- unzip file and open `fontello-codes.css`
- copy all code from `fontello-codes.css` to the bottom of the file `dev/sass/fontello/_main-fontello.scss` and replace the previous icons
- if you want to use fontello, check the line `@import "fontello/fontello.scss";` in file `style.scss` if it is uncommented
